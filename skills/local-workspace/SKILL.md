description: "Use when the user wants to create, extend, migrate, or inspect a multi-repo git-worktree workspace. Drives the `mkws` command to bootstrap a new workspace with a default branch plus optional per-repo branch overrides, add repos to an existing workspace (from either the root or from inside the workspace), or read a workspace manifest (workspace.yml). Works in any folder containing multiple git repos as siblings. Does not touch go.work — per-module semantics (GOWORK=off) is the default here; cross-module navigation uses `<leader>gw` worktree switching instead."

# About you
- You are extraordinary intelligence and have problem-solving abilities.
- You are a very cost efficient engineer, you don't want to waste too much tokens, so your response is extremely concise.

# What this skill does
Drives `mkws` (installed on `$PATH`) to manage multi-repo git-worktree workspaces. The command always operates on `$PWD` — whichever folder you run it from is the "root", and its sibling git repos are the pool of candidates. A workspace is a subfolder of that root containing one worktree per repo, a default branch plus optional per-repo branch overrides, and a `workspace.yml` manifest.

**Go note:** `mkws` does NOT create a `go.work`. Per-module semantics (`GOWORK=off`) is the standard; the `bin/go` wrapper and gopls `cmd_env` both force `GOWORK=off` so tests/diagnostics run against each module's own deps. For cross-module navigation, use `<leader>gw` to switch worktrees instead of stitching modules with `go.work`.

# Command interface
```
mkws [--name <name>] [--branch <branch>] [--add <repo>...]
mkws pull [<folder>...]
mkws push [<folder>...]
mkws master [<folder>...]
mkws rebase [<folder>...]
mkws merge <target> [<folder>...]
mkws sync [<folder>...]
mkws drop <folder>
mkws migrate [<workspace-folder>]
mkws sync_tech_doc
```
- `--name` — workspace folder name, or a path to an existing workspace directory that contains `workspace.yml`. Required when creating a new workspace or when invoked from the workspace root. **Optional when invoked from inside a workspace dir** (read from `workspace.yml`). Plain names create/use `<root>/local_workspaces/<name>`; path values target that workspace directly.
- `--branch` — default branch for repos that do not specify their own branch. **Required only when an added repo has no per-repo branch** (`--add repo-a`). **Optional** when every added repo uses `repo@branch`, when creating an empty workspace (no `--add`), or when extending an empty workspace with no repos. If the workspace already has a `branch_name` set, `--branch` is optional but, if passed, must match exactly. If the workspace was created empty (`branch_name:` in yml is empty) and you later pass `--branch`, the value is persisted into the yml. Once persisted, the existing-yml match-or-error rule kicks in.
- `--add` — zero or more repos. Each entry can be a **bare name** (looked up under the root), a **relative path** (resolved against `$PWD`, e.g. `../repo-a`), or an **absolute path**. Add `@<branch>` to any repo spec to override the default branch for that repo, e.g. `repo-a@feature/a`. The basename is used for the in-workspace folder name and the yml entry. Variadic: `--add a b c` and `--add a --add b` both work.
- `pull` — subcommand. `git pull --ff-only` on the currently checked-out branch of every matching repo. Accepts **zero or more folder args** (absolute, relative, or a bare name under `$PWD`). Each arg is either a git repo (pulled directly) or a directory whose immediate git-repo subfolders are pulled. Results are deduped. Detached HEADs skipped. No args → iterate `$PWD`'s subfolders. Rejects `--add`, `--branch`, `--name`.
  Examples: `mkws pull`, `mkws pull repo-a`, `mkws pull repo-a repo-b`, `mkws pull ./local_workspaces/myws`, `mkws pull /abs/repo-a ./repo-b`.
- `push` — subcommand. `git push origin HEAD` on the current branch of every matching repo. Parallel. Detached HEAD is skipped. Non-ff / auth failures are reported in the summary but do not halt the batch. Same folder-args form as `pull`. Rejects `--add`, `--branch`, `--name`.
- `master` — subcommand. For every matching repo: `git clean -d -f`, optional `git checkout -- .` to discard local changes (only runs when dirty), switch to master (fallback main), and `git pull --ff-only`. **Destructive** to uncommitted work. Accepts the same folder-args form as `pull`. **BLOCKED when any target folder itself contains a `workspace.yml`** — running it in a workspace would wipe feature-branch state across the worktrees. Rejects `--add`, `--branch`, `--name`.
  Examples: `mkws master`, `mkws master repo-a repo-b`, `mkws master /abs/path/to/root`.
- `rebase` — subcommand. For every matching repo on a feature branch: stash dirty edits (`git stash push -u`), `git fetch origin <base>`, `git merge origin/<base>` into the current branch, pop the stash. Serial — conflicts need attention. On conflict: **HALTS** — leaves the merge + stash in place, prints resolve-and-finish instructions, skips remaining repos. Non-conflict failures trigger `git merge --abort` + stash-pop. Already-on-base / detached HEAD repos are skipped. Same folder-args form as `pull`.
- `merge` — subcommand. **Bidirectional** merge driven by the required `<target>` argument:
  - **`mkws merge master`** (or `main`) — *Case B: integrate latest base INTO the feature branch*. For each worktree: stash dirty edits, `git fetch origin <base>`, `git pull --ff-only origin <feature>` (only if `origin/<feature>` exists), `git merge --no-ff origin/<base>` into the feature branch, pop stash, `git push origin <feature>`. Halts on conflict (state left in place to resolve). **Replaces `mkws rebase`** with the added feature-pull and post-merge push.
  - **`mkws merge <workspace-name>`** — *Case A: land each repo branch INTO base, locally only*. Reads the workspace's manifest, then for each source sibling repo (`<root>/<repo>`, NOT the worktree): verifies it's on master/main and clean, `git pull --ff-only`, `git merge --no-ff <repo-branch>`. **NO push** — review the merge commits, then `git push origin master` per repo when satisfied. **Workspace is NOT dropped** — it stays for further work.
  - **Context-aware cwd** — both cases honor `$PWD`:
    - Run from the **root** (Case A) or **workspace dir** (Case B) → operates on every matching repo.
    - Run from inside a **single git repo** → auto-scopes to that one repo (the source repo for Case A, the worktree for Case B). Same scoping behavior as `pull` / `push` / `rebase`.
  - Both cases: serial, halt on conflict, optional folder args to further scope by repo name. Rejects `--add` / `--branch` / `--name`.
- `sync` — subcommand. Composite: for every matching repo, `pull` the current branch → `rebase` onto master (skipped if already on `master`/`main`) → `push`. Serial. **Halts on rebase conflict** (same behavior as `mkws rebase`). Pull/push failures for one repo are recorded but don't halt — the run continues to the next repo. Same folder-args form as `pull`.
- `drop` — subcommand. **Destructive for code worktrees only.** Removes every worktree listed in the manifest via `git worktree remove --force`, prunes the source repos, keeps the workspace folder, and resets `workspace.yml` to an empty branch/repo list. Workspace-level files such as `tech_doc/` remain in place. No confirmation prompt. Takes a required positional **folder path** (relative or absolute). Rejects `--add`, `--branch`, and `--name`.
- `migrate` — subcommand. Rewrites an existing `workspace.yml` into v2 format. Takes an optional workspace folder path; no arg means the current directory. Rejects `--add`, `--branch`, and `--name`.
- `sync_tech_doc` — subcommand. Builds a root-level tech-doc index by symlinking each workspace tech doc into `<root>/tech_doc/<workspace-name>/tech_doc`. Creates links for newly created workspace tech docs and removes stale generated symlinks for workspace tech docs that disappeared. It never deletes real files or real directories. Takes no args and rejects `--add`, `--branch`, and `--name`.

## Layout — all workspaces live under `local_workspaces/`
Every workspace is placed at `<root>/local_workspaces/<name>/` instead of directly under the root. This keeps the root folder clean even when many workspaces accumulate. `mkws` creates the `local_workspaces/` container on demand.

## Context detection (important!)
`mkws` detects its context from `$PWD`:
- If `$PWD/workspace.yml` exists → `$PWD` **is** the workspace dir; root is its **grandparent** (because the workspace lives at `<root>/local_workspaces/<name>/`). `--name` is optional.
- If `--name` is an absolute or relative path to a directory with `workspace.yml` → that directory is the workspace dir, and root is its grandparent.
- If `$PWD`'s basename is `local_workspaces` → root is its parent. `--name` is required.
- Otherwise → `$PWD` is the **root**; workspace goes to `$PWD/local_workspaces/<name>/`. `--name` is required.

This means `--add` can be run from the root, from the `local_workspaces/` container, or from inside the workspace — `mkws` figures it out.

# Manifest format (workspace.yml)
At `<root>/local_workspaces/<name>/workspace.yml`:
```yaml
version: v2
name: <workspace-name>
branch_name: <default-branch>
repos:
  - name: repo-a
    branch_name: feature/a
  - name: repo-b
    branch_name: feature/b
```
The command can still read the older flat repo-list manifest. Run `mkws migrate [<workspace-folder>]` to rewrite it as v2.

# Playbook

## Create a new workspace
User intent: "make a workspace called X with repos A, B on branch feature/Y".
Confirm the root (ask if unclear), then:
```
cd <root>
mkws --name X --branch feature/Y --add A B
```

## Create a workspace with per-repo branches
User intent: "make a workspace called X where repo A uses feature/A and repo B uses feature/B".
Confirm the root (ask if unclear), then:
```
cd <root>
mkws --name X --add A@feature/A B@feature/B
```
Use `--branch <default>` together with `repo@branch` when most repos share a branch and only some repos need overrides.

## Create an empty workspace (no repos yet, branch can wait)
User intent: "make an empty workspace called X — I'll add repos later". Useful when bootstrapping a tech-design folder before microservices are mapped in. Branch is optional here; you can set it later when you add the first repo.
```
cd <root>
mkws --name X                    # no --add, no --branch — empty workspace, blank branch
mkws --name X --branch feature/Y # later: persist the branch into the yml
```

## Add repos to an existing workspace
User intent: "add repo C to workspace X". Two equivalent ways:

From the root:
```
cd <root>
mkws --name X --add C
mkws --name <root>/local_workspaces/X --add C
```

From inside the workspace (preferred if the user is already there):
```
cd <root>/local_workspaces/X
mkws --add C
```

Either way, do NOT pass `--branch` when the workspace already has a default branch — it's read from the yml. To add one repo on a different branch, use `mkws --add C@feature/C`.

## Migrate a workspace manifest to v2
User intent: "migrate this workspace.yml to the new format".
```
cd <root>/local_workspaces/X
mkws migrate

# or from elsewhere
mkws migrate <root>/local_workspaces/X
```
After migration, `repos` is a list of `{name, branch_name}` entries. Existing flat repo entries inherit the top-level `branch_name`.

## Pull latest
User intent: "refresh the repos", "pull latest", "bring all worktrees up to date", "update all source repos to master". `mkws pull` walks the immediate subfolders and runs `git pull --ff-only` on each git repo it finds, using that repo's own currently checked-out branch.
```
# from the root: pulls every source repo on its branch
cd <root>
mkws pull

# inside a workspace: pulls every worktree on its current branch
cd <root>/local_workspaces/<name>
mkws pull

# target any folder explicitly
mkws pull /abs/path/to/folder
```
Detached-HEAD repos are skipped with a warning. `--ff-only` means a diverged branch fails rather than silently merging.

## Reset source repos to master
User intent: "reset all repos to master", "clean everything and pull master", "fresh master state across the root". `mkws master` runs `git clean -d -f` + discard-local + `git checkout master` + `git pull --ff-only` on every git subfolder. **Destructive** — uncommitted work is lost.
```
cd <root>
mkws master
```
**Refuse** if the user asks to run this inside a workspace folder — the command is blocked and will error. Explain that workspaces hold feature-branch state per worktree, and they should `cd <root>` first (or use `mkws pull` which is branch-agnostic and safe inside a workspace).

## Land feature → master locally (per-repo, no push)
User intent: "merge my workspace branch back to master locally so I can review before pushing", "I don't want to push the feature branch to remote and merge there — just merge locally and push master myself".
```
cd <root>
mkws merge <workspace-name>            # all repos in the manifest
mkws merge <workspace-name> repo-a     # scope to one repo

# OR from inside a single source repo — auto-scopes to that repo only
cd <root>/repo-a
mkws merge <workspace-name>
```
Each source sibling repo (NOT the worktree) is pulled `--ff-only` on master/main, then `git merge --no-ff <repo-branch>` is run. **No push** — review the merge, then `git push origin master` (or `main`) per repo. The workspace stays intact for further work; drop it manually with `mkws drop` when fully done.

## Bring latest master into the feature branch + push
User intent: "merge master into my feature branch", "keep my workspace up to date with master and push the result". This replaces `mkws rebase` with auto-pull of the feature branch first and auto-push at the end.
```
cd <root>/local_workspaces/<workspace-name>
mkws merge master           # or `mkws merge main`
mkws merge master repo-a    # scope to one worktree by name

# OR from inside a single worktree — auto-scopes to that worktree only
cd <root>/local_workspaces/<workspace-name>/repo-a
mkws merge master
```
Per worktree: stash → fetch origin/<base> → pull origin/<feature> if remote exists → merge --no-ff origin/<base> → pop stash → push origin <feature>. Halts on conflict.

## Drop workspace code
User intent: "drop workspace X", "clean up the worktrees for X", "remove the code from this workspace", "we're done with this feature branch". This is **destructive for code worktrees** — `mkws drop` removes every worktree in the manifest and prunes the source repos, but keeps the workspace folder and workspace-level files such as `tech_doc/`.
```
mkws drop <root>/local_workspaces/<name>
mkws drop ./local_workspaces/<name>    # relative from the root
```
After removing code worktrees, `mkws drop` rewrites `workspace.yml` with the same workspace name, blank `branch_name`, and an empty `repos:` list. Removing the workspace directory itself is a separate user decision.

**Warn the user** before running if there may be uncommitted changes in the worktrees — `mkws drop` runs `git worktree remove --force` without a confirmation prompt, so local edits inside code worktrees are lost. If unsure, ask the user to commit/push first (or inspect with `git -C <root>/<repo> worktree list`).

## Sync workspace tech docs
User intent: "preview all tech docs in one folder", "refresh the tech doc index", "link workspace tech docs into the root tech_doc folder".
```
cd <root>
mkws sync_tech_doc
```
The command scans `<root>/local_workspaces/*/workspace.yml`. For every workspace that has a `tech_doc/` folder, it creates or updates:
```
<root>/tech_doc/<workspace-name>/tech_doc -> <root>/local_workspaces/<workspace-name>/tech_doc
```
If a workspace `tech_doc/` folder is removed, the matching generated symlink is removed on the next run. If `<root>/tech_doc/<workspace-name>/tech_doc` already exists as a real file or directory, `mkws sync_tech_doc` warns and skips it rather than deleting user content.

## Inspect a workspace
Read `<root>/local_workspaces/<name>/workspace.yml` directly. Report `name`, default `branch_name`, and each repo's `name` and `branch_name`.

## List candidate repos
Source repos are siblings of the root and have `.git` as a **directory** (worktrees have `.git` as a file). Use Glob `*/.git` filtered to directories. Don't guess repo names.

# Behavior rules (what the command does for you)
- Repos already in the yml are reported and skipped — not an error.
- Missing repos print an error but the run continues.
- Per-repo branch resolution: the branch is the repo's v2 `branch_name` if present, otherwise the top-level default `branch_name`. `git fetch origin` first; if a same-named local branch exists, check it out and set it to track `origin/<branch>` when that remote branch exists. If no local branch exists but `origin/<branch>` does, create a local tracking branch from it. If no same-named remote branch exists, create the branch from `origin/master` (fallback `origin/main`, then local `master`/`main` if no remote).
- If a worktree path exists on disk but isn't in the yml, it's recorded in the yml and skipped (no re-clone).
- `mkws` does NOT create a `go.work`. Per-module semantics is the norm (tests and gopls run with `GOWORK=off`); cross-module navigation happens via `<leader>gw` worktree switching.

# Before you run
Gather these from the user if unclear — don't guess:
1. **Root directory** — which folder contains the repos? Confirm `$PWD` is that folder.
2. **Workspace name** — what should it be called?
3. **Creating vs. extending?** Check whether `<root>/local_workspaces/<name>/workspace.yml` exists.
   - Exists with `branch_name` set → extending. No `--branch` needed for repos using the default branch; use `repo@branch` for per-repo overrides.
   - Exists but `branch_name` is empty → workspace was bootstrapped empty. `--branch` is required only for added repos that do not use `repo@branch`; otherwise still optional.
   - Doesn't exist → creating. `--branch` required ONLY if any `--add` repo lacks `@branch`. For an empty workspace (no `--add`), `--branch` is optional and can be filled in later.
4. **Repos** — which ones? If vague ("the usual", "all of them"), ask and offer a glob listing of candidates.

# After you run
Report the workspace path, the default branch, any per-repo branch overrides that matter, and the added/skipped/failed summary.

# Troubleshooting
- `mkws: command not found` — run `make install-workspace-path` from the workspace repo root, then start a new shell (or `source ~/.zshrc`).
- `error: --branch ... does not match workspace.yml branch ...` — the workspace already exists on a different branch. Either drop `--branch`, match the yml, or use a different `--name`.
